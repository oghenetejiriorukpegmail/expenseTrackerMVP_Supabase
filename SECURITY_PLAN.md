# ExpenseTracker Security Enhancement Plan

This document outlines potential future security enhancements for the ExpenseTracker application based on common web security best practices.

## 1. Input Validation & Sanitization
- [ ] **Server-Side Validation:** Rigorously validate all incoming API data (types, formats, lengths, ranges) using `zod` schemas for all routes.
- [ ] **SQL Injection Prevention:** Continue using Drizzle ORM correctly with parameterized queries. Audit any raw SQL usage.
- [ ] **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Prevention:**
    - [ ] Ensure all user-generated content rendered in the frontend is properly escaped (React default behavior helps, double-check any `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`).
    - [ ] Implement a stricter Content Security Policy (CSP) via `helmet` for production, potentially refining directives beyond defaults.
- [ ] **Output Encoding:** Ensure API responses are correctly encoded (e.g., `Content-Type: application/json`).

## 2. Authentication & Authorization
- [ ] **Strong Password Policy:** Implement and enforce minimum password complexity requirements during signup/password change.
- [ ] **Password Hashing:** Verify that `passport-local` (or the underlying mechanism) uses a strong, salted hashing algorithm (like bcrypt).
- [ ] **Rate Limiting:** Add rate limiting to login endpoints and potentially other sensitive API routes (`express-rate-limit`).
- [ ] **Authorization Checks:** Audit all API endpoints to ensure users can only access/modify their *own* trips and expenses. Implement resource-based authorization checks in route handlers or middleware.

## 3. Secure Session Management
- [ ] **Secure Cookies:** Review `express-session` configuration to ensure `secure: true` (in production), `httpOnly: true`, and `sameSite: 'lax'` or `'strict'` attributes are set for session cookies.
- [ ] **Session Secret:** Ensure the `SESSION_SECRET` is strong, unique, and loaded securely from environment variables (not hardcoded).
- [ ] **Session Timeouts:** Configure appropriate session inactivity timeouts.
- [ ] **Session ID Regeneration:** Confirm session IDs are regenerated upon successful login.

## 4. Server-Side Security (Express)
- [ ] **CSRF Protection:** Implement CSRF token protection for all state-changing requests (POST, PUT, DELETE) using middleware like `csurf`.
- [ ] **Secure File Uploads:**
    - [ ] Review `multer` configuration for strict file type and size validation.
    - [ ] Consider adding malware scanning for uploads if feasible.
    - [ ] Ensure uploads are stored securely (e.g., outside webroot or in cloud storage) and accessed via authorized routes, not direct URLs. Use non-guessable filenames.
- [ ] **Error Handling:** Ensure detailed error information (stack traces) is not sent to the client in production environments. Log errors server-side.

## 5. Dependency Management
- [ ] **Regular Audits:** Schedule regular checks using `npm audit`.
- [ ] **Update Strategy:** Keep dependencies, especially security-critical ones, updated.

## 6. Infrastructure & Deployment
- [ ] **HTTPS Enforcement:** Ensure the production deployment enforces HTTPS for all traffic.
- [ ] **Secrets Management:** Use environment variables or a dedicated secrets manager for all sensitive credentials (DB connection strings, API keys, session secrets). Ensure `.env` files are in `.gitignore`.
- [ ] **Logging & Monitoring:** Enhance logging for security-relevant events (logins, failed logins, authorization failures) and set up monitoring/alerting.

## 7. Security Testing
- [ ] **SAST/DAST:** Integrate automated security testing tools into the CI/CD pipeline if possible.
- [ ] **Penetration Testing:** Consider periodic manual penetration testing as the application evolves.
